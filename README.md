## Steps to reproduce the error

1. Open the project in Android Studio using the command `npx cap open android`.
2. Run it on an Android device using an USB cable. The device needs to have the Developer Options menu enabled: https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/mobile-devices/how-do-i-turn-on-the-developer-options-menu-on-my-samsung-galaxy-device/. From the Developer Options menu USB-Debugging should also be enabled.
3. When the app is opened it might need you to allow it to use the device's camera.
4. Go to `chrome://inspect/#devices` in Google Chrome. You should be able to see your connected device there. Click on `inspect` in order to be able to debug the app with Google DevTools. Open up the console.
5. In the Capacitor App click the button 'Take Photo' and then from the below options, choose `Take Picture`. Don't actually take a picture.
6. Observe what is going on in the console after pressing the `back` button of the device.
7. There is an error message `User cancelled photos app`.
